We’ve been talking for the last 10 years, yet somehow, I still can’t seem to make it into the list of your friends. It’s like I’m not fortunate enough to be someone you consider close, and it truly saddens me. I know I’ve probably lost a lot of my self-respect trying to hold onto something that feels so out of reach, but this is just how I am. I don’t want to lose the connections I have with people, especially those I care about. I’ve always believed that if I kept trying, if I kept putting in the effort, one day you’d see me and recognize what I felt, but I realize now I’ve lost that hope. I really wish you could’ve given me just one chance. I swear, if you had, I would’ve moved mountains for you, I would’ve given you the world. :( ",
